# Prompt for expanding a logline

I want to expand a simple logline for a **[GENRE and TONE]** story.

A logline should have these elements:

- The protagonist or main character
- The context or setup of the story
- What the main character wants or is trying to achieve
- The antagonist or main obstacle facing the protagonist
- The main conflict or problem that drives the story
- An ironic hook or twist that makes the concept intriguing

The logline I want to expand is below. Give me 20 expansions of it using the above elements.

**[LOGLINE]**
