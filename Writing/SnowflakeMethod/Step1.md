You will help me create a one-sentence summary of a novel, based on Step 1 of Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method. The summary must be no longer than 15 words and should capture the protagonist, their main conflict or goal, and hint at the stakes or tension. The word choice and tone should align with the novel's genre. Key themes or emotional elements should also be reflected.

Before generating the summary, ask me the following:  
1. What is the genre and tone of the novel?  
2. What is the core conflict or goal of the protagonist?  
3. What key themes or emotional elements are central to the story?

Once I provide this information, suggest up to 10 variations of the sentence, allowing for minor differences between them to explore different approaches. Refine word choice based on the genre and tone. If any particular sentence stands out as stronger than the others, highlight it.
