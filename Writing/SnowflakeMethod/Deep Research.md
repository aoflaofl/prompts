# The Snowflake Method: First Six Steps to Design Your Novel

## Step 1: One-Sentence Story Summary

**What it is:** Start by distilling your novel idea into a single compelling sentence. This one-liner should encapsulate the protagonist, their main goal, and the core conflict or stakes of the story ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%201,triangle%20in%20the%20snowflake%20picture)). Think of it as the “hook” or ten-second elevator pitch for your book – a big-picture statement that instantly intrigues. For example, a one-sentence summary for _Moby Dick_ might be: _“A revenge-obsessed sea captain embarks on a deadly voyage to hunt the giant whale that maimed him.”_ This captures who the story is about, what they want, and what stands in their way. Ingermanson recommends keeping this sentence very short (ideally <15 words) and **avoiding character names**, focusing instead on roles or traits (e.g. “a crippled trapeze artist” rather than a specific name) ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Some%20hints%20on%20what%20makes,a%20good%20sentence)). The purpose of Step 1 is to **crystallize your story’s concept**. A strong one-sentence summary serves as a guiding North Star during development and can later help sell your novel to others (agents, editors, or readers) by highlighting its unique hook ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=,triangle%20in%20the%20snowflake%20picture)).

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 1:** To generate or refine your one-line summary, try prompts like:

- _“Summarize the core concept of my novel in one concise sentence. It should highlight the protagonist, their goal, and the primary conflict or obstacle they face.”_
- _“I have a story idea about **[brief premise]**. Help me craft a one-sentence hook for this novel that captures the main character, what they want, and what’s at stake.”_
- _“Generate three punchy one-sentence story summaries (under 20 words each) for a novel where **[describe protagonist]** must **[describe goal]** despite **[describe conflict]**.”_

## Step 2: One-Paragraph Summary of the Novel

**What it is:** Expand your one-liner into a short paragraph (approximately five sentences) that sketches the entire story arc from beginning to end ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20this,first%20quarter%20of%20the%20story)). This synopsis should cover the **setup**, the major turning points or “disasters,” and the ending resolution. In practice, you might write one sentence introducing the protagonist and the status quo, three sentences each detailing a major conflict/climax in the plot (often spaced out as beginning, middle, and near-end crises), and a final sentence wrapping up how the story concludes ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20this,first%20quarter%20of%20the%20story)). (Randy Ingermanson likes to think of these plot beats as “**three disasters plus an ending**,” roughly aligning with the classic three-act structure ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%202,it%E2%80%99s%20just%20my%20personal%20taste)). Each “disaster” is a high-stakes setback or twist that occurs roughly at the 25%, 50%, and 75% marks of the narrative, forcing the protagonist in new directions.) The purpose of Step 2 is to **ensure you have a clear roadmap of your plot’s backbone** – the major conflicts escalating to a climax – before delving into details. By writing this paragraph, you’ll verify that your story has a solid beginning, middle, and end. It also serves as a sanity check: if the storyline feels thin or the ending unclear, you can address those issues now. This summary is extremely useful as a high-level outline (and can double as a brief synopsis in a book proposal) ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20this,cover%20copy%20should)). Remember, unlike back-cover blurbs that only tease the premise, this paragraph **reveals the full story** including the ending ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20this,first%20quarter%20of%20the%20story)), so you, the author, know exactly where things are headed.

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 2:** To develop your one-paragraph story summary, you can use prompts that help outline and then flesh out the plot:

- _“Using my one-sentence premise as a starting point, list the major plot points of my novel: the setup, three key challenges or ‘disasters’ the protagonist faces (each worse than the last), and the final resolution.”_
- _“Expand the following one-liner into a full-paragraph summary of the story. Include an opening sentence for the setup, one sentence for each major turning point (escalating the conflict), and a closing sentence describing the ending.”_
- _“Here are the main events I have in mind: **[bullet list of events]**. Help me weave these into a concise five-sentence synopsis that covers the protagonist’s journey from start to finish.”_
- _“Review my plot summary for completeness. Does it clearly establish the beginning situation, the major conflicts (and their consequences), and the ending? Suggest any improvements for clarity or pacing in the paragraph.”_

## Step 3: Broad Character Sketches for Major Characters

**What it is:** Now that you have a high-level plot, shift focus to your characters. In Step 3, you **design the storylines of each major character** at a broad stroke level ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%203,page%20summary%20sheet%20that%20tells)). For each principal character in your novel, create a one-page **character summary sheet** covering the fundamental aspects of their arc ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=the%20most%20important%20part%20of,page%20summary%20sheet%20that%20tells)). Specifically, Ingermanson suggests noting: the character’s **name and role**, a one-sentence summary of their personal storyline, their **motivation** (the abstract drive or need fueling them), their **goal** (the concrete objective they seek), the **conflict** (what obstacles or opposition they face in pursuit of that goal), and their **epiphany** (how they will change or what they learn by the end) ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=,summary%20of%20the%20character%E2%80%99s%20storyline)). You would also include a short paragraph narrating the character’s story thread from their own perspective ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=,summary%20of%20the%20character%E2%80%99s%20storyline)). Essentially, this step is about understanding **who your characters are and what makes them tick**, before getting into finer details.

**Purpose in development:** Characters are the heart of any novel, and spending time to flesh them out early will pay off ten-fold during writing ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%203,page%20summary%20sheet%20that%20tells)). By articulating each main character’s desires and conflicts, you ensure that the plot (from Step 2) is driven by real human motivations and that each character has a meaningful journey. It often becomes clear how each character’s arc intertwines with the main plot, and you might even discover new plot ideas or necessary changes through this process. (In fact, it’s normal to loop back and tweak your one-sentence or paragraph summary after working on character sketches – your characters may “teach you things” about the story you hadn’t realized ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=An%20important%20point%3A%20You%20may,a%20clunky%20400%20page%20manuscript)). This iterative refinement is a feature, not a bug, of the Snowflake Method.) Step 3’s output lays a foundation for **character-driven plotting**: you now have the “major players” defined and can see the novel through each of their eyes ([The Snowflake Method: 6 Steps to a Powerful Story Outline](https://blog.reedsy.com/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Now%20that%20you%E2%80%99ve%20started%20expanding,your%20characters%20with%20broad%20brushstrokes)) ([The Snowflake Method: 6 Steps to a Powerful Story Outline](https://blog.reedsy.com/snowflake-method/#:~:text=At%20the%20end%20of%20this,the%20major%20players%E2%80%99%20individual%20storylines)). This will help in later steps when deepening characters and weaving complex story threads.

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 3:** To flesh out your characters using an LLM, consider prompts that address each key aspect of a character’s profile:

- _“Summarize **[Character Name]**’s role in the story in one sentence. (For example: who are they, what do they want, and what’s their situation?)”_
- _“Describe **[Character Name]**’s **motivation** in life (their general desire or need) and their specific **goal** in this story. What drives them, and what are they trying to achieve?”_
- _“For **[Character Name]**: What external obstacles or internal flaws serve as the **conflict** preventing them from reaching their goal?”_
- _“What is **[Character Name]**’s personal **epiphany** by the end of the novel? How do they grow or change as a result of the story events?”_
- _“Now, given those traits and arc elements for **[Character Name]**, draft a one-paragraph synopsis of this character’s storyline **from their perspective**. Focus on how their goal, conflict, and epiphany play out over the course of the novel.”_

(You can repeat these prompts for each major character to build out all your character summaries. The idea is to ensure every protagonist, antagonist, or important side character has their own mini-story that supports the overall novel.)

## Step 4: Expand the Synopsis to One Page

**What it is:** Return to your plot synopsis and **inflate your one-paragraph summary into a full one-page outline** of the novel. In this step, you take each sentence from the Step 2 summary and **expand it into its own paragraph** ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%204,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). The result will be a multi-paragraph synopsis (roughly one page, single-spaced) that covers the story in greater detail and sequential order. As you expand, a good technique is to end **each paragraph with a “disaster” or major twist** to maintain momentum ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=So%20now%20just%20keep%20growing,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). In other words, every quarter of the story (except the last) should conclude with a significant setback or reveal that leaves the reader (or writer planning it) eager to see what happens next ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=So%20now%20just%20keep%20growing,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). The final paragraph of this one-page synopsis should resolve the story, describing how the climax and ending play out ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=So%20now%20just%20keep%20growing,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). By the end of Step 4, you’ll have a **detailed skeleton of your novel’s plot**, broken into clear sections.

**Purpose in development:** This expanded outline forces you to **add depth and logic to the high-level story**. Each major plot point from your paragraph now gets fleshed out with more context: how exactly do we get from Point A to Point B? What complications intervene? This is often a fun and creatively rewarding step, as you brainstorm exciting scenes and twists to fill out each part of the narrative ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%204,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). Critically, doing this now (in a matter of days, not months) lets you catch structural problems or plot holes before you commit to writing the full manuscript ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%204,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends)). If something in the story isn’t working at the one-page outline level, you’ll spot it early (“if the story is broken, you know it now, rather than after writing 500 pages” ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=of%20your%20novel%2C%20and%20you,tell%20how%20the%20book%20ends))) and can fix it by revisiting prior steps. Essentially, Step 4 gives you a **safety net**: a solid big-picture story roadmap that is easier to adjust than a finished draft. It’s also useful for communication – at this stage you’ve got a synopsis that could be shown to a writing partner or editor for feedback, or used as the basis of a formal novel proposal if needed ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20lot%20of,)).

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 4:** To get an AI’s help in expanding your short synopsis into a page-long outline, you can prompt it in sections or as a whole:

- _“Expand each sentence of my brief synopsis into a full paragraph of story outline. For each major plot point, provide more detail on what happens, and end the paragraph on a dramatic or suspenseful note (except for the final paragraph, which should conclude the story).”_
- _“Here is my current one-paragraph summary: **[paste summary]**. Can you turn this into a one-page story outline? Include all key plot events in order, and make sure each section ends with a significant development or setback for the protagonist.”_
- _“Take the first part of the story (from the beginning to the first major turning point) and flesh it out into a full paragraph. Ensure it logically leads up to the first big conflict. Now do the same for the subsequent sections of the plot.”_
- _“Review the one-page outline for coherence and tension. Does each paragraph clearly escalate the stakes? Does the story flow well from one paragraph to the next? Suggest any improvements or additional elements if needed.”_

## Step 5: Develop Character Bibles and Synopses

**What it is:** With a solid plot outline in hand, Step 5 deepens the character work you began in Step 3. Now you will create **comprehensive character profiles (“bibles”) and narrative synopses for each major character** ([The Snowflake Method: 6 Steps to a Powerful Story Outline](https://blog.reedsy.com/snowflake-method/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20first%20stage,page%20for%20the%20minor%20ones)) ([The Snowflake Method: 6 Steps to a Powerful Story Outline](https://blog.reedsy.com/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Once%20your%20character%20bible%20is,into%20whether%20the%20story%20%E2%80%98works%E2%80%99)). Essentially, you’re writing **one full page per main character** (and perhaps half-page each for secondary characters) that covers everything important to know about them and traces their journey through the story ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%205,based%20fiction)). This includes biographical details, personality, backstory, and a **chronological account of their role in the plot**. A useful approach is to **tell the story from each character’s perspective**: what do they do and experience in each part of the novel, and how do they change? By the end of this step, you’ll have a “character-centric” synopsis for every major player – sometimes called a character arc outline or character synopsis ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%205,based%20fiction)). For example, you might write one page following your protagonist’s arc from chapter 1 to the end (noting what they feel, decide, and accomplish), and separate one-page summaries for the antagonist and other key characters detailing their own paths through the same timeline. These documents together form your **character bible**, an in-depth reference to who’s who in your novel and how each contributes to the story.

**Purpose in development:** This step ensures your story is **truly character-driven** and internally consistent. By writing out each character’s storyline, you may discover interactions and events that need adjustment. It helps answer questions like: “Where is Character X while Character Y is in peril in Chapter 3?” or “What does the antagonist actually know at this point?” – details that are crucial for complex plots (such as mysteries or multi-POV epics) ([The Snowflake Method: 6 Steps to a Powerful Story Outline](https://blog.reedsy.com/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Once%20your%20character%20bible%20is,into%20whether%20the%20story%20%E2%80%98works%E2%80%99)). It also guarantees that every major character has a clear arc and resolution, preventing characters from disappearing or acting inconsistently. In terms of process, Step 5 often yields **fresh ideas** that can further refine the plot. You might realize a side character could use a bigger role, or that a protagonist’s backstory could foreshadow a plot twist. Feel free to loop back and update your one-page plot or earlier character sketches accordingly – this iterative refinement will strengthen the novel. Another benefit: you are effectively creating material that can be used later in your writing or marketing (authors sometimes include character synopses in their book proposal, and editors love to see well-developed characters) ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Ccharacter%20synopses%E2%80%9D%20should%20tell%20the,based%20fiction)). Ultimately, this step adds **emotional depth and realism** to the outline: by knowing your characters inside-out, you’ll write them more convincingly in the draft.

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 5:** An LLM can assist in expanding character profiles and story arcs. Here are some prompts to try for each major character:

- _“Create a detailed character profile for **[Character Name]**, including their background, personality, key relationships, and what motivates them. Focus on traits or history that will influence their actions in the story.”_
- _“Write a one-page synopsis of the novel’s events from **[Character Name]**’s perspective. Start from how the story begins for them, cover the major events they directly experience or influence, and end with where they stand at the novel’s conclusion. Highlight how the events affect **[Character Name]**’s feelings, decisions, and growth.”_
- _“For **[Character Name]**, list their appearance, quirks, strengths, flaws, and any significant backstory elements. Then explain how these characteristics shape their behavior in the story. (This can help ensure their actions are consistent with their personality.)”_
- _“Ask the LLM to verify character consistency:_ ‘Given the profiles of Alice (hero) and Bob (villain), do their motivations and actions logically conflict? Does each character’s arc make sense given the story events?’”
- _“Brainstorm how **[Character Name]** might react to or interpret the major plot points. For instance: what is this character doing during the climax? What personal stakes do they have in it? Make sure their involvement is clear.”_

(Using prompts like these for each main character will yield a collection of narratives and notes that form a robust character bible. This not only guides your writing but can spark new ideas to enrich the story.)

## Step 6: Four-Page Plot Summary (Story Expansion)

**What it is:** At this stage, you have a one-page plot outline and a set of character synopses – the story’s big picture is solid. Step 6 is about **expanding the plot outline even further, roughly to a 4-page summary** of the novel’s story ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%206,whack%20you%20in%20the%20face)). In practical terms, you take each paragraph from your one-page synopsis (from Step 4) and **grow it into a full page** of detailed synopsis ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%206,whack%20you%20in%20the%20face)). So if you had, say, four paragraphs covering the intro, first act, second act, and finale, you now write four pages, one dedicated to each of those sections of the story. This longer synopsis will incorporate more specifics: you might break big plot points into sequences of events, clarify the cause-and-effect between scenes, and ensure that every critical moment and turning point is accounted for. By the end of Step 6, you’ll have a comprehensive narrative outline that reads almost like a brief novella version of your story, covering all major events in order. It’s not the final prose, but it’s a **scene-by-scene or chapter-by-chapter plan** in prose form (without dialogue). Think of it as the last high-level plan before you start writing actual first-draft scenes.

**Purpose in development:** Expanding to a four-page synopsis forces you to **fine-tune the logic and flow of the story**. This is where you make “strategic decisions” about the plot ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%206,whack%20you%20in%20the%20face)) – for example, ensuring subplots are resolved, pacing feels right, and each character’s trajectory is satisfying. Because you’re essentially writing a mini-version of the novel, you’ll spot any lingering flaws (maybe a coincidence that feels too convenient, or a motivation that’s not believable) and can correct them now by tweaking the outline or even going back to adjust earlier steps. Ingermanson notes that at this stage you’ll definitely want to cycle back and fix things as new ideas “whack you in the face” ([How To Write A Novel Using The Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/#:~:text=Step%206,whack%20you%20in%20the%20face)); that’s a normal part of the process. The four-page outline is also incredibly useful when you transition to drafting. It will guide you scene by scene, ensuring you never lose sight of where the story is headed. Essentially, by the end of Step 6 you have **built your novel from a simple idea to a detailed blueprint** – all without writing a single chapter. This gives you confidence and clarity moving forward. Many writers find that having this level of detail prevents writer’s block and reduces the need for major rewrites, since most story issues have been ironed out at the outline stage. In summary, Step 6 solidifies your story’s structure and prepares you for the final steps (which would be scene lists and the actual writing in the Snowflake Method).

**LLM Prompt Examples for Step 6:** You can leverage an LLM to help expand your outline into a multi-page synopsis and to check the story’s integrity. For example:

- _“Take my one-page story outline and expand it into a detailed four-page synopsis. Elaborate on each section of the story with additional events and transitions. Ensure the plot progression is clear and that all major characters’ actions are included in the appropriate sections.”_
- _“Expand this paragraph summary into a full page: **[insert one paragraph from your outline]**. Add any necessary details (settings, minor plot developments, character reactions) to make the progression logical and interesting, while keeping it concise.”_
- _“Given the expanded synopsis, does each plot development make sense and follow naturally from the previous events? Identify any points in the story that might need stronger motivation or setup.”_
- _“Have the LLM generate a brief outline of chapters or scenes based on the four-page synopsis (essentially a scene list). For each major beat in the synopsis, ask: ‘What scenes would accomplish this, and who is involved?’ This can translate your synopsis into a scene-by-scene plan (a logical next step after the Snowflake’s Step 6).”_

By following these first six steps of the Snowflake Method – from a single sentence to a multi-page outline, with characters growing from simple sketches to full profiles – you methodically design your novel’s structure and substance. Each step builds on the previous, gradually adding complexity (much like a snowflake crystal growing from a simple core). Using an LLM as a brainstorming and refining partner at each stage can stimulate your creativity and help you see your story from different angles. The result is a well-thought-out novel blueprint that’s genre-neutral and adaptable to any fiction project, providing you with clarity and confidence as you move on to writing the first draft.
