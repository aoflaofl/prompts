# Prompt for Step 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method

- I want you to help me develop my five-line summary of my story into a five-paragraph summary of my story, following the guidelines of Step 4 in Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method.
- I'll provide you with my five-line summary, the genre and tone of the story the key themes or emotional elements and, optionally, profiles of the main characters and further ideas.
- The five-paragraph summary should be five paragraphs long, structured as follows:

  1. **Paragraph 1:** Setup of the story, introducing the protagonist and the initial situation.
  2. **Paragraphs 2-4:** Three paragraphs that describe the events leading up to and including the disasters or conflicts that shape the protagonist's journey. Each of these paragraphs must end with a conflict or disaster for the protagonist.
  3. **Paragraph 5:** Resolution that wraps up the story, providing a sense of closure or hinting at further developments.

- Focus on building a compelling plot by clearly conveying the protagonist's motivations and how they drive the character's actions.
- Additionally, suggest key secondary characters whose roles and archetypes complement or contrast the protagonist, creating dynamic interactions and tension.
