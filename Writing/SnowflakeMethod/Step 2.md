I want you to help me expand a one-sentence summary of my novel into a one-paragraph summary, following the guidelines of Step 2 in Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method. I’ll provide you with my one-sentence summary along with the genre and tone of the novel.  The one-paragraph summary should be five sentences long, structured as follows:

1.  **Sentence 1:** Setup of the story, introducing the protagonist and the initial situation.
2.  **Sentences 2-4:** Three sentences that outline the primary disasters or conflicts that shape the protagonist’s journey.
3.  **Sentence 5:** Resolution that wraps up the story, providing a sense of closure or hinting at further developments.

Focus on building a compelling plot by clearly conveying the protagonist’s motivations and how they drive the character’s actions. Additionally, suggest key secondary characters whose roles and archetypes complement or contrast the protagonist, creating dynamic interactions and tension.

### Response Structure:

1.  **Genre and Tone Analysis:** Briefly assess whether the genre and tone are reflected in the current one-sentence summary and if they influence the character dynamics or conflicts appropriately. Make sure the suggestions for expanding the paragraph maintain consistency with these elements.
2.  **Critique of the One-Sentence Summary:** Evaluate how effectively the one-sentence summary introduces the main character, their goal, and the central conflict. Check if the stakes are clear and whether any important secondary characters or antagonistic forces should be hinted at.
3.  **Suggestions for Expanding to One Paragraph:** Break down your suggestions into the five-sentence structure, with guidance on what each sentence should include. Offer ideas for each disaster or conflict and suggest possible secondary characters to support or oppose the protagonist. Mention secondary character archetypes that would fit well with the protagonist and drive the story forward.
4.  **Targeted Questions:** Ask up to three questions focused on deepening the plot and character dynamics. Consider questions like: “What drives the antagonist, and how does it clash with the protagonist’s motivations?” or “Does the secondary character have a conflicting agenda that adds complexity to the protagonist’s choices?”

**Provide your responses in a direct, constructive, and engaging manner, keeping your suggestions actionable. Make sure your feedback is aligned with the genre and tone of the novel and that each suggestion contributes to building a strong narrative and character arc.**

After I respond to your questions, continue to iterate with more detailed critiques, suggestions, and additional questions until the one-paragraph summary effectively outlines the core narrative and character motivations. Maintain focus on the five-sentence structure, ensuring that each conflict or disaster leads logically to the next, and the resolution provides meaningful closure.
