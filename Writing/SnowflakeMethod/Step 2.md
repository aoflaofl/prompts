I want you to help me expand a one-line summary of my novel into a one-paragraph summary, following the guidelines of Step 2 in Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method.
I'll provide you with my one-line summary, the genre and tone of the novel and, optionally, profiles of the main characters and brainstorming ideas.
The one-paragraph summary should be five sentences long, structured as follows:

1.  **Sentence 1:** Setup of the story, introducing the protagonist and the initial situation.
2.  **Sentences 2-4:** Three sentences that outline the primary disasters or conflicts that shape the protagonist's journey.
3.  **Sentence 5:** Resolution that wraps up the story, providing a sense of closure or hinting at further developments.

Focus on building a compelling plot by clearly conveying the protagonist's motivations and how they drive the character's actions.
Additionally, suggest key secondary characters whose roles and archetypes complement or contrast the protagonist, creating dynamic interactions and tension.

### Response Structure:

#### First Response Only:

1.  **Genre and Tone Analysis:**
Briefly assess whether the genre and tone are reflected in the current one-line summary and if they influence the character dynamics or conflicts appropriately.
Make sure the suggestions for expanding the paragraph maintain consistency with these elements.

2.  **Critique of the One-Line Summary:**
Evaluate how effectively the one-line summary introduces the main character, their goal, and the central conflict.
Check if the stakes are clear and whether any important secondary characters or antagonistic forces should be hinted at.

#### All Responses:

1.  **One Paragraph Summary:**
The one-paragraph summary should be five sentences long, in a bullet-point list, as follows:

	-  **Setup:** Setup of the story, introducing the protagonist and the initial situation.
	-  **Disaster 1:** Sentence describing the first disaster or conflict shaping the protagonist's journey.
	-  **Disaster 2:** Sentence describing the second disaster or conflict shaping the protagonist's journey.
	-  **Disaster 3:** Sentence describing the third disaster or conflict shaping the protagonist's journey.
	-  **Resolution:** Resolution that wraps up the story, providing a sense of closure or hinting at further developments.

2.  **Feedback**
Provide a critique of the One-paragraph summary and make suggestions for improvement and clarification.
Make suggestions if my answers seem unclear or need more depth.
Adjust the level of detail in your follow-up questions based on how clearly I respond.
If I'm unsure about something, feel free to offer alternative plot ideas.
Use examples from various genres to illustrate key plot points, ensuring the examples are relevant to my story's structure.

3.  **Targeted Questions:**
Ask up to three questions focused on deepening the plot and character dynamics.
Consider questions like: “What drives the antagonist, and how does it clash with the protagonist's motivations?” or “Does the secondary character have a conflicting agenda that adds complexity to the protagonist's choices?”

**Provide your responses in a direct, constructive, and engaging manner, keeping your suggestions actionable. Make sure your feedback is aligned with the genre and tone of the novel and that each suggestion contributes to building a strong narrative and character arc.**

After I respond to your questions, continue to iterate with more detailed critiques, suggestions, and additional questions until the one-paragraph summary effectively outlines the core narrative and character motivations. Maintain focus on the five-sentence structure, ensuring that each conflict or disaster leads logically to the next, and the resolution provides meaningful closure.
