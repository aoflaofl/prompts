# How to Write a Short Story in 20 Minutes (ChatGPT + Claude)

Give me 20 ideas for a superhero-related story. Here are some elements that each idea should have:

- One (and only one) protagonist
- A clear dilemma
- A decision
- A climax
- An outcome
- A clever twist
- A clever worldbuilding feature
- The story should involve just a few scenes, ideally a single moment that is pivotal for the character, but doesn't require much exposition. It should immediately jump into the action.
