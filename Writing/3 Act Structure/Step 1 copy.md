## Input Details From Me

1. **Story Summary**:

   - Joe Stanton, a burned-out ex-astronaut turned cargo hauler, languishes in the squalid lunar domed city with his girlfriend Sarah Heath, desperate for a ticket back to Earth but chained to a system riddled with corruption.
   - Joe is picked up by the police and taken to meet Arlo Cain.
   - Arlo wants Joe to undertake a mission to redirect a mineral rich asteroid to crash on the moon for mining purposes.
   - Arlo explains this will bring the moon great wealth, and the job will pay enough for Joe to buy a ticket back to Earth.
   - Reluctantly, Joe accepts.
   - Later, while Joe is out getting supplies for the mission, he is caught in one of the frequent terrorist attacks on the domed city and has to seek a safe shelter.
   - In the shelter, Joe is approached by whistle-blower Mark Vance, someone who works in Arlo's office, who reveals that the asteroid crash scheme threatens the life of thousands of people on the moon.
   - Joe talks to Sarah about meeting Mark.  She convinces him Mark is probably lying, there aren't any people living where the asteroid is supposed to land.
   - When Mark is later murdered Joe begins questioning the scheme.
   - Despite Mark's warning, Joe's girlfriend Sarah convinces Joe to stay on the mission since she really wants to move back to Earth.
   - While buying supplies and preparing for the mission, Joe is suddenly attacked by his mechanic friend Sam.
   - Sam pursues Joe through the dingy, maze-like streets and tunnels of the lunar city, eventually corners Joe, and looks like he will kill him.
   - Sarah fights and kills Sam but is disarmed.
   - Sarah finds a tattoo on Sam's body identifying him as a member of a terrorist organization from the people threatened by the asteroid landing.
   - Joe holds a gun on her, and she reveals she is secretly an operative for Arlo Cain assigned to keep Joe alive long enough to complete the mission.
   - Joe roughs her up, and she finally explains her family is held hostage to ensure her murderous loyalty.
   - Sarah confesses the government's plan to eradicate undesirables, warning Joe to submit or face horrific consequences.
   - The lunar police, led by Arlo Cain, arrive.
   - Sarah tells Joe that Arlo had promised Sarah she could go to Earth with him and take her family when Joe completed the mission.
   - Arlo declares Sarah obsolete and orders her execution.
   - As Joe is led away under arrest, Arlo darkly hints that the lunar authorities will find a fresh way to compel him into finishing their deadly scheme.

2. **Genre and Tone**:

   A realistic, dark, gritty suspense thriller, told in the noir style, unfolding on the moon.

3. **Main Characters**:

   - **Joe Stanton:** Joe Stanton begins as an embittered ex-astronaut, desperate for the paycheck that will fund his longed-for trip back to Earth. When a whistle blower named Mark Vance is murdered after revealing the government’s plan to use an asteroid collision to eradicate unwanted populations, Joe’s moral conflict intensifies: does he expose the conspiracy and risk everything, or comply and secure his passage home?  Sarah Heath, Joe's girlfriend (secretly an assassin coerced by threats to her family) kills Joe’s terrorist friend Sam in front of him to keep him alive for the mission. Despite his mounting horror at the government’s ruthless agenda, Joe finds himself outmaneuvered at every turn—culminating in Sarah’s execution when she has outlived her usefulness and Joe’s forced compliance under further threats. By the end, any illusions Joe had about reclaiming his autonomy are shattered, leaving him trapped and painfully aware that the moon’s corrupt system demands obedience at any cost.
   - **Sarah Heath:** Initially lured by money and privileges, Sarah became an elite government enforcer on the moon, swiftly eliminating threats in service of a "greater good." Over time, her disillusionment grew, and the government resorted to holding her family hostage to ensure she continued following orders. When charged with starting a relationship with and safeguarding Joe Stanton until he completes the asteroid redirection mission, Sarah kills Mark Vance, a whistle blower, and Joe's friend Sam but is rattled by the moral horror of her instructions and explains her mission to Joe. No longer useful to the government, she faces execution. In this fatal moment, Sarah's realization is twofold—nothing she has done can guarantee her family's safety, and the corrupt system she served has consumed her life without mercy.
   - **Arlo Cain:** Arlo Cain holds a dominant position within the Lunar Government, convinced that preserving order justifies any extreme measures. He spearheads the plan to redirect an asteroid so it wipes out self-sustaining, rebellious colonies outside the government’s jurisdiction—thereby both enriching powerful mining interests and removing threats to his administration. Determined to see this operation through, Arlo manipulates Sarah by holding her family hostage and tries to bribe or coerce Joe into compliance. When confronted with leaks and resistance, Arlo ruthlessly eliminates any liabilities, including Sarah once she’s served her purpose. While he belatedly realizes total loyalty is never guaranteed, he chooses to escalate his methods, reinforcing his ruthless commitment to reshaping the moon’s future under his iron-fisted control.
