# An Experiment to get AI through the steps of the Snowflake Method

## Experiment Goal

Develop prompts to get AI through steps 1 to 6 of Randy Ingermanson's Snowflake Method quickly.

### Rationale

Develop and improve the prompts to get AI to create original, well written long form prose outlines. The idea is that if the prompts work well for AI created content, they will work better when applied to human created content.

## File Organization

1. One file of brainstorming ideas
1. One file for each main character
1. One file for the brief story outline containing:
   - Genre and Tone
   - One Line Summary
   - One Paragraph Summary
1. One file for the five paragraph summary

## Steps

### Brainstorming

This step is the most unstructured and will have the most human involvement and will likely take the longest. The AI will be used to generate many ideas for the story and the human will decide which ones to consider for the story. The AI will generate ideas quickly, but finding the good ones takes time.

#### Brainstorming Goal

Generate and filter ideas.

#### Brainstorming Prompts Used

- `NerdyNovelist/brainstorm.md`
- `NerdyNovelist/GenreResearch.md`
- `Brainstorming/possibilities.md`

#### Output

After completing this step you should have at least (but will probably have much more):

- The protagonist or main character
- The context or setup of the story
- What the main character wants or is trying to achieve
- The antagonist or main obstacle facing the protagonist
- The main conflict or problem that drives the story
- An ironic hook or twist that makes the concept intriguing

Put all the ideas generated you wish to consider for the story in a file called `Brainstorm.md`.
