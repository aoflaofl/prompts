# **Fiction Character Profile Development Workbook**

Use this workbook as a printable guide to craft detailed character profiles **before** deciding on genre or plot. It’s structured as a checklist and fill-in-the-blank template for brainstorming fully realized characters. Developing each character in depth at this stage will help ensure they feel real and consistent in your story – character checklists give you a systematic way to explore each character’s wants, needs, background, and traits ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=Character%20checklists%20can%20help%20you,ones%20onstage%20at%20the%20moment)). Remember, readers can tell when a character is underdeveloped, so this process helps avoid “half-baked” characters ([The Best Character Template Ever (100+ Character Traits!)](https://www.dabblewriter.com/articles/character-template#:~:text=To%20help%2C%20here%20is%20a,the%20bottom%20of%20this%20article)). Don’t neglect secondary characters either; even side characters need clear motivations, backgrounds, and goals ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=Let%20me%20also%20stress%20that,and%20goals%20of%20the%20villain)) to support the story effectively.

**How to use this guide:** Print out a copy for each major character. Fill in answers for each prompt – write notes, bullet points, or short paragraphs in the blanks provided. If something doesn’t apply or isn’t decided yet, skip it or mark it to revisit later. For **main characters**, try to complete every section with as much detail as possible. For **supporting characters**, you can be selective – focus on the most relevant details for their role. After filling out individual profiles, use the **Cast Balancing Checklist** to compare your characters and ensure a diverse, dynamic ensemble.

## **Main Character Profile Template**

*Use this template for your protagonist or any primary character (including deuteragonists or major antagonists). Fill out all sections to build a rich, nuanced profile. Main characters drive the story, so understanding them deeply will inform your plot and themes.*

### **Basic Information**

- **Name:**  ______________________________________________________
- **Age:**  ________________________________________________________
- **Gender Identity:**  _____________________________________________
- **Role in Story:**  _______________________________________________  *(e.g., protagonist, deuteragonist “secondary lead”, antagonist)*
- **Archetype/Trope (if any):**  _____________________________________  *(e.g., Hero, Rebel, Mentor, Everyman)*
- **Occupation/Day-to-Day Role:**  __________________________________  *(job, student, etc.)*
- **Socioeconomic Class:**  _________________________________________  *(economic status or class background)*
- **Other Identifiers:**  ____________________________________________  *(any notable labels: e.g., royalty, outsider, chosen one)*

### **Physical Description (Appearance & Voice)**

- **Overall Appearance:**  __________________________________________  *(brief summary of looks and presence)*
- **Eye Color & Shape:**  ___________________________________________
- **Hair:**  ________________________________________________________  *(color, length, style)*
- **Skin Tone:**  ___________________________________________________
- **Build/Height:**  ________________________________________________
- **Facial Features:**  _____________________________________________  *(face shape, distinguishing marks like freckles, scars)*
- **Distinctive Marks:**  ___________________________________________  *(tattoos, birthmarks, scars)*
- **Posture & Body Language:**  _____________________________________  *(how they carry themselves, gait, typical gestures)*
- **Voice:**  _______________________________________________________  *(tone, pitch, accent, pace of speech)*

- **Physical Disabilities/Conditions:**  ______________________________  *(if any, e.g., mobility issues, chronic illness)*
- **Other Notes (Appearance):**  _____________________________________

*Tip:* Go beyond basic hair/eye color – small details like how your character walks or their fashion sense can add depth ([The Best Character Template Ever (100+ Character Traits!)](https://www.dabblewriter.com/articles/character-template#:~:text=Physical%20appearance%20is%20what%20someone,of%20depth%20for%20your%20reader)). For example, do they shuffle nervously or stride confidently? Do they speak with a stutter or a lilting accent? Such traits make the character more vivid in the reader’s mind.

### **Personality & Psychology**

- **Personality Type:**  _____________________________________________  *(e.g., brief descriptor like “shy and altruistic” or Myers-Briggs/Enneagram type)*
- **Key Personality Traits:**  _______________________________________  *(e.g., brave, cynical, impulsive, compassionate – both positive and negative traits)*
- **Basic Nature/Temperament:**  ____________________________________  *(optimistic or pessimistic? Calm or hot-headed?)*
- **Values & Beliefs:**  ____________________________________________  *(core principles or morals guiding them)*
- **Biggest Strength (Character):**  _________________________________  *(their most admirable quality)*
- **Biggest Weakness (Character):**  _________________________________  *(their most problematic trait)*
- **Internal Conflicts:**  __________________________________________  *(any inner struggles or contradictions; e.g., “confidence vs. self-doubt”)*
- **Coping Mechanisms:**  ___________________________________________  *(how do they handle stress or emotional pain? e.g., humor, isolation, seeking help, distraction)*
- **Habits or Rituals:**  ____________________________________________  *(daily routines or habits – coffee every morning? meditation? biting nails?)*
- **Pet Peeves:**  __________________________________________________  *(small things that annoy or irritate them)*
- **Phobias/Fears:**  _______________________________________________  *(irrational fears or anxieties, if any)*
- **Outlook on Life:**  _____________________________________________  *(hopeful, jaded, nihilistic, idealistic, etc.)*
- **Sense of Humor:**  ______________________________________________  *(what do they find funny or not?)*
- **Emotional Reaction Style:**  ____________________________________  *(do they explode in anger, quietly seethe, cry easily, hide feelings behind a smile?)*
- **Quirks:**  ______________________________________________________  *(odd little behaviors or idiosyncrasies – e.g. talks to plants, always corrects others’ grammar)*
- **Hobbies/Interests:**  ___________________________________________  *(activities they enjoy or pursue)*
- **Intelligence/Education:**  ______________________________________  *(street-smart, book-smart, degree, self-taught?)*
- **Skills/Talents:**  _______________________________________________  *(special skills, talents or proficiencies – from sword-fighting to playing violin)*
- **Known Languages:**  _____________________________________________  *(if multi-lingual, include sign language, fictional languages, etc.)*

*Tip:* When defining personality, consider how your character **responds to problems and challenges**. For instance, what do they do when under stress – do they take charge, seek help, or panic? ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=geek%2C%20caregiver%2C%20baker%29%208,would%20never%20let%20anyone%20see)) Also think about behaviors they do **too much** or **too little** of ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=9,point%20where%20the%20story%20will)) (e.g., talking, trusting others, taking risks). These tendencies reveal coping mechanisms and can spark internal conflicts. Make sure to include some flaws or weaknesses alongside strengths so the character feels balanced and human.

### **Motivations, Goals & Fears**

- **Core Motivation:**  _____________________________________________  *(what fundamentally drives them in life? e.g., desire for love, ambition for power, search for belonging)*
- **Goal(s) – Short Term:**  ________________________________________  *(what do they want *right now* or in the near future?)*
- **Goal(s) – Long Term/Aspirations:**  ______________________________  *(big dreams or life-long ambitions)*
- **Deepest Fear(s):**  _____________________________________________  *(what are they most afraid of? failure, loneliness, death, a specific nightmare scenario?)*
- **Needs (Emotional or Practical):**  _______________________________  *(what do they truly need, which might differ from what they *want*)*
- **Desires/Wants:**  _______________________________________________  *(other notable desires or wishes, even minor ones)*
- **Secrets:**  _____________________________________________________  *(anything significant they’re hiding?)*
- **Primary Conflict/Problem:**  ____________________________________  *(what major problem or dilemma are they facing as the story begins?)*
- **What’s at Stake:**  _____________________________________________  *(consequences if they fail to achieve goals or overcome fear)*

*Note:* A character’s **goals and fears** often form the heart of their story. Consider not only *what* they want, but *why* they want it (motivation) and *what’s preventing* them from getting it (conflict). For example, a character might deeply desire acceptance but fear abandonment, creating an internal tug-of-war that will drive their decisions. Be specific – “wants to prove herself to her father’s ghost” is more vivid than “wants to be successful.” If you know some plot details, outline external goals too; if you don’t, focus on internal goals and fears that could translate into any plot.

### **Backstory & Past Influence**

- **Birthplace:**  _________________________________________________
- **Birthday/Zodiac (optional):**  _________________________________
- **Family of Origin:**  ___________________________________________  *(parents, guardians, extended family details)*
- **Upbringing & Childhood:**  _____________________________________  *(overall childhood environment – loving, abusive, strict, impoverished, etc.)*
- **Significant Childhood Memory:**  ________________________________  *(an early event that still affects them)*
- **Education History:**  __________________________________________  *(schooling, training, mentor relationships, etc.)*
- **Past Careers/Jobs:**  __________________________________________  *(if applicable)*
- **Trauma or Life-Altering Events:**  ______________________________  *(major past incidents: deaths, accidents, triumphs, failures)*
- **Past Relationships:**  _________________________________________  *(notable ex-friends or ex-partners, etc., that left an impact)*
- **Skeletons in Closet:**  ________________________________________  *(shameful secrets or past misdeeds)*
- **Proudest Accomplishment (Past):**  ______________________________
- **Biggest Regret:**  _____________________________________________
- **Past Lessons Learned:**  _______________________________________  *(what experiences shaped their worldview?)*

*Tip:* Backstory may never fully appear in your novel, but it **informs everything** about your character’s present. Identify formative experiences – for example, a childhood trauma that still haunts them ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=1,kind%20of%20life%20s%2Fhe%20wants)) or a mentor who taught them a critical skill. Each item in the past can connect to a trait in the present (e.g., “Grew up in poverty, now extremely frugal and anxious about money”). Knowing these influences will help you portray consistent and believable behavior. *(Remember: you can always add more detail later; start with the highlights.)*

### **Relationships & Connections**

*(List important people in the character’s life and note the relationship dynamics.)*

- **Parents/Guardians:**  __________________________________________  *(names, status – alive/deceased, and relationship quality)*
- **Siblings:**  _________________________________________________   *(if any, and brief notes on relationship)*
- **Extended Family:**  ___________________________________________  *(grandparents, cousins, etc. that matter to the character)*
- **Closest Friend(s):**  __________________________________________  *(and how they met, what bonds them)*
- **Romantic Partner(s):**  ________________________________________  *(significant other, spouse, lover, or crush)*
- **Mentor/Teacher:**  _____________________________________________  *(if someone guided or trained them)*
- **Rival(s):**  ___________________________________________________  *(who competes or conflicts with them and why?)*
- **Enemy/Antagonist:**  ___________________________________________  *(who actively opposes them? can be same as rival or different)*
- **Subordinate/Protégé:**  ________________________________________  *(if they mentor or lead someone else)*
- **Group Affiliations:**  _________________________________________  *(teams, clubs, organizations, gangs, etc. they are part of)*
- **Pet(s):**  _____________________________________________________  *(any animal companions and their names)*
- **Public Persona:**  _____________________________________________  *(how are they seen by society or their community?)*
- **Key Relationship Dynamics:**  ___________________________________  *(note any important dynamic: e.g., “always trying to impress father,” “protective of younger sister,” “secretly in love with best friend”)*

*Note:* Think about how each relationship **shapes or reveals** your character. A character might act differently with a childhood friend than with a boss. Jot down not just who the person is, but the emotional tone of the relationship (supportive, strained, competitive, loving, toxic, etc.). These relationships can be sources of conflict or support in your story. Make sure to include at least a few entries here – even if the character is a loner, that itself is telling (and you might list a *lack* of connections or a past loss).

### **Cultural Background**

- **Ethnicity/Nationality:**  ______________________________________
- **Language(s):**  ________________________________________________  *(mother tongue and other languages spoken)*
- **Religion/Beliefs:**  ___________________________________________  *(organized religion, spiritual beliefs, or lack thereof)*
- **Traditions/Customs:**  _________________________________________  *(cultural traditions they follow or celebrate)*
- **Societal Role:**  ______________________________________________  *(their role/status in community or culture – e.g., elder’s child, outcast, leader)*
- **Childhood Locale:**  ___________________________________________  *(the cultural/geographic environment they grew up in)*
- **Accent or Dialect:**  __________________________________________  *(if different from the norm in your story’s setting)*
- **Cultural Influences:**  ________________________________________  *(important cultural values or norms that influence their behavior)*
- **Class/Social Standing:**  ______________________________________  *(upper-class, working-class, etc., if not noted elsewhere)*
- **Migration History:**  __________________________________________  *(if they or their family moved between places/cultures)*

*Note:* Understanding a character’s cultural background adds realism and depth. Elements like ethnicity, native language, and traditions are key parts of identity ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=person%20have%20a%20nickname%3F%209,ethnicity%2C%20race%2C%20and%20native%20language)). Even if your story’s world is fictional or fantastical, think about the cultures or social groups your character belongs to. How do these influence their worldview, speech, or lifestyle? For example, a character raised in a strict religious tradition might have different values or inner conflicts than one from a secular background. Represent these elements respectfully and avoid stereotypes – focus on how the character *personally* relates to their culture (embracing it, rebelling against it, etc.).

### **Neurodivergence & Mental Health** *(if applicable)*

- **Neurodivergent or Mental Health Condition:**  ___________________  *(e.g., ADHD, autism, dyslexia, anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc.)*
- **Diagnosis Status:**  ___________________________________________  *(Are they officially diagnosed or self-identified? Do they even realize it?)*
- **Symptoms/Traits:**  ____________________________________________  *(What does this look like for them? Describe how it manifests in their daily life – behaviors, challenges, strengths)*
- **Coping Strategies:**  __________________________________________  *(How do they manage or “mask” their condition, if they do? Therapy, medication, routines, support from others?)*
- **Impact on Life:**  _____________________________________________  *(Note areas where this affects them: social interactions, work, self-image, etc.)*
- **Stigma or Support:**  __________________________________________  *(Do people around them know or understand? Are they supportive, or does the character hide this aspect?)*

*Note:* Only fill this section if it’s relevant for your character. If so, approach it with sensitivity and nuance. A neurodivergent or mentally ill character should be more than a collection of symptoms – remember that while such traits are part of who they are, **they do not define the character’s entire identity** ([On Writing Neurodivergent Characters - Writer's Digest](https://www.writersdigest.com/write-better-fiction/on-writing-neurodivergent-characters#:~:text=Writers%20will%20often%20shorthand%20neurodivergent,they%20are%20not%20their%20autism)). Show these aspects as just one thread in a rich tapestry of personality. It’s wise to research any condition you’re incorporating and avoid clichés or “one-note” portrayals. Whenever possible, **focus on the human being first and the condition second**. (If you’re not from the represented group, consider consulting beta readers or sensitivity readers from that background ([Writing 'Diverse' Characters 2: Disability & Neurodiversity - Elise Carlson](https://elisecarlson.com/2024/02/07/writing-diverse-characters-part-2-big-dos/#:~:text=Even%20when%20simply%20putting%20marginalized,their%20own%20experiences%20and%20input)) to ensure accuracy and respect.)

### **Skills & Abilities**

- **Notable Skills/Talents:**  ______________________________________  *(what are they *particularly* good at? e.g., swordsmanship, cooking, computer hacking, negotiation, painting)*
- **Training/Education:**  _________________________________________  *(special training, apprenticeships, higher education, etc. that contribute to skills)*
- **Professional Skills:**  ________________________________________  *(skills related to their occupation)*
- **Hobbies/Interests Skills:**  ___________________________________  *(skills stemming from hobbies – e.g., plays guitar, speaks French, knows herbal remedies)*
- **Physical Abilities:**  _________________________________________  *(strength, agility, endurance, marksmanship, etc., including any magical abilities if in a fantasy context)*
- **Intellectual Abilities:**  _____________________________________  *(analytical thinking, memory, quick learner, etc.)*
- **Interpersonal Skills:**  _______________________________________  *(charisma, empathy, leadership, etc.)*
- **Resourcefulness:**  ____________________________________________  *(ability to improvise or make do with what’s at hand)*
- **Other Strengths:**  ____________________________________________  *(anything not covered above – e.g., “lucky”, “determined”)*

- **Equipment/Tools:**  ____________________________________________  *(any special tools, weapons, or equipment they are skilled at using)*
- **Magic/Supernatural Powers:**  _________________________________  *(if applicable, list powers and their proficiency/control level)*
- **Weaknesses (Skills):**  ________________________________________  *(areas they are notably lacking in – e.g., poor fighter, bad at math, clumsy with technology)*

*Tip:* This section highlights what your character **can do**. It’s helpful for ensuring your cast has a variety of competencies. When filling this out, think about **how their skills might serve or hinder** them in different situations. Also note any gaps – a character who is a brilliant strategist might be physically weak, etc. Such contrasts create opportunities for teamwork with other characters (one character’s strengths compensating for another’s weakness).

### **Flaws & Vulnerabilities**

- **Character Flaws:**  ____________________________________________  *(their major shortcomings on a personal level – eg., pride, cowardice, selfishness, naivety)*
- **Temper Triggers:**  ____________________________________________  *(what easily angers or upsets them?)*
- **Insecurities:**  _______________________________________________  *(what do they feel self-conscious or unsure about?)*
- **Bad Habits/Vices:**  ___________________________________________  *(smoking, drinking, procrastinating, lying, etc.)*
- **Recurring Mistakes:**  _________________________________________  *(patterns of behavior that get them into trouble – eg., always trusts the wrong people)*
- **Achilles’ Heel:**  _____________________________________________  *(a specific weakness that others could exploit – can be physical or emotional)*
- **Limits:**  _____________________________________________________  *(something they absolutely cannot or will not do?)*

*Note:* Flaws are what make characters relatable and give them room to grow. Be honest here – even heroes have imperfections. Do their flaws create conflict in relationships? Do they know about their own flaws or are they oblivious? Consider also external vulnerabilities (Kryptonite for Superman-type examples) if relevant. These weaknesses will often tie into your story’s conflict – for instance, a fear or flaw they must overcome by the end.

### **Role in Story & Character Arc**

- **Narrative Role:**  _____________________________________________  *(Protagonist, Antagonist, Secondary Lead, Love Interest, Mentor, etc.)*
- **Role Details/Purpose:**  _______________________________________  *(What function do they serve in the story? E.g., “hero driving main plot,” “comic relief sidekick,” “provides expert knowledge,” “emotional support for protagonist”)*
- **Character Arc (Planned):**  _____________________________________  *(How will they grow or change by the end of the story? What lesson might they learn? Or, if they’re static, note that they remain steadfast and how that affects the story)*
- **Internal Journey:**  ___________________________________________  *(The inner change – e.g., “overcomes guilt and finds self-forgiveness”)*
- **External Journey:**  ___________________________________________  *(The outward change in circumstances – e.g., “rises from novice to leader of the team”)*
- **Archetypal Role:**  ____________________________________________  *(if applicable, which archetype do they embody in the narrative structure? e.g., Hero, Shadow, Guardian, Trickster)*
- **Thematic Role:**  ______________________________________________  *(how do they illustrate or challenge a theme of the story? e.g., represents “loyalty” theme, tests the theme of “justice vs mercy”)*

*Note:* This section connects your character to the **story**. If you haven’t solidified your plot, you can sketch a hypothetical arc (for example, if the character’s biggest flaw is pride, maybe their arc is to learn humility). Identifying their role (especially for main characters) ensures you know why they exist in the narrative. A protagonist typically drives the story’s action, an antagonist creates conflict, a mentor guides the hero, etc. Consider also how the character’s personal growth (or downfall) will play out. Even antagonists can have arcs (e.g., descending into obsession). If you have multiple main characters (protagonist and deuteragonist, for instance), clarify how their roles differ. This will help in the next step when you look at your cast as a whole.

## **Supporting Character Profile Template**

*Use this template for each supporting or minor character in your story.* Supporting characters may include sidekicks, friends, family members, mentors, co-workers, antagonist’s henchmen – anyone who plays a part but isn’t the central protagonist. You might not fill as many details as with a main character, but it’s still important to outline their key traits and purpose. Even secondary characters should have their own clear identity and motivation ([Character Checklists | Fill One Out for Every Character in Your Book - Marylee MacDonald Marylee MacDonald](https://maryleemacdonaldauthor.com/character-checklists/#:~:text=Let%20me%20also%20stress%20that,and%20goals%20of%20the%20villain)), while ultimately serving the story needs of the protagonist or plot. (A good rule: every supporting character should **support or challenge the protagonist in a meaningful way** ([Balancing Out Your Cast of Characters ~ September C. Fawkes - Editor, Writer, Instructor](https://www.septembercfawkes.com/2022/06/balancing-out-your-cast-of-characters.html#:~:text=Consider%20what%20role%20the%20character,character%20who%20offers%20meaningful%20exchanges)).)

**Tip:** Secondary characters should feel like real people with lives of their own, but they shouldn’t steal focus. Know *enough* about them to write them consistently. Fill the basics below, and add any additional details from the main template that are relevant. If a supporting character is very important (a deuteragonist or a primary antagonist), you may want to use the full main character template for them as well.

### **Basic Info & Role**

- **Name:**  _______________________________________________________
- **Age:**  ____________  **Gender:**  ______________________________
- **Role/Relationship to Protagonist:**  ____________________________  *(e.g., best friend, mentor, rival, boss, comic relief, antagonist’s ally)*
- **Role in Story Purpose:**  _______________________________________  *(what function do they serve in the narrative? e.g., confidant, love interest, obstacle, etc.)*
- **Key Character Traits (brief):**  _________________________________  *(a few adjectives – e.g., loyal and goofy, or stern but caring)*
- **Notable Physical Traits:**  _____________________________________  *(anything that stands out: height, style, etc.)*
- **Cultural/Ethnic Background:**  _________________________________  *(if relevant to character or adds diversity)*
- **Personality Quirk:**  __________________________________________  *(one memorable quirk or habit)*

### **Motivation & Background**

- **Personal Goal or Want:**  _______________________________________  *(even supporting characters want something – what drives them?)*
- **Motivation:**  _________________________________________________  *(why do they want that goal? what need or desire underlies it?)*
- **Fear or Weakness:**  ___________________________________________  *(something that holds them back or an insecurity)*
- **Connection to Protagonist’s Journey:**  _________________________  *(how do their goals or actions intersect with the main character’s story?)*
- **Backstory Snapshot:**  __________________________________________  *(a very brief note on background – one or two past details that inform who they are, e.g., “former soldier who owes protagonist a debt,” “childhood friend who grew up in same hometown”)*
- **Key Relationship:**  ____________________________________________  *(aside from protagonist, any other relationship vital to them? e.g., their own family or a mentor)*
- **Loyalty/Alignment:**  __________________________________________  *(whose side are they on? protagonist’s ally, antagonist’s side, neutral? do they switch?)*

### **Skills & Flaws**

- **Strength or Skill:**  __________________________________________  *(something they’re good at or known for)*
- **Notable Weakness/Flaw:**  _______________________________________  *(a character flaw or limitation)*
- **Contribution to Group:**  _______________________________________  *(how do they help the protagonist or the overall team, if there is one? e.g., provides knowledge, emotional support, comic relief)*
- **Conflict with Others:**  ________________________________________  *(any particular character they clash with, and why)*
- **Unique Trait:**  ________________________________________________  *(anything unique not covered: e.g., accent, catchphrase, hobby, etc., that makes them memorable)*

### **Story Role & Future**

- **Appears in:**  _________________________________________________  *(which parts of the story or which plot arc they are involved in)*
- **Character Arc (if any):**  ______________________________________  *(do they change over the story or mostly stay the same? e.g., “learns to stand up for herself” or “static comic relief character”)*
- **Fate:**  _______________________________________________________  *(if known, what happens to them by the end? e.g., survives and gets promoted, tragically dies, etc.)*
- **Notes/Importance:**  ____________________________________________  *(any additional notes on why this character matters in the story – theme they represent, foil to another character, etc.)*

*Reminder:* Every supporting character should in some way **support, contrast, or influence** your main character or plot ([Balancing Out Your Cast of Characters ~ September C. Fawkes - Editor, Writer, Instructor](https://www.septembercfawkes.com/2022/06/balancing-out-your-cast-of-characters.html#:~:text=In%20her%20book%2C%20Story%20Genius%2C,help%20facilitate%20the%20protagonist%27s%20story)) ([Balancing Out Your Cast of Characters ~ September C. Fawkes - Editor, Writer, Instructor](https://www.septembercfawkes.com/2022/06/balancing-out-your-cast-of-characters.html#:~:text=Consider%20what%20role%20the%20character,character%20who%20offers%20meaningful%20exchanges)). Check that this character has a clear reason to be in the story. If you find you can’t identify their purpose, consider either developing them further or combining them with another character. On the other hand, well-drawn supporting characters can greatly enrich your story’s world and emotional impact. Use this template to give them enough depth that they feel believable (they have their own lives and agendas) while keeping their narrative role in focus (they help move the story along, not derail it).

## **Cast Balancing Checklist**

After creating profiles, review your **cast of characters** as a whole. Use this checklist to ensure variety and balance among your characters. A compelling story often has a dynamic ensemble where each character is distinct in personality, background, and role. Go through each point and see if your cast meets the criteria. (You can literally check these off ✅ as you verify them.)

- **Distinct Personalities:** No two characters are carbon copies. Each has at least one trait that makes them stand out (e.g., one is quiet and brooding, another is loud and cheerful, etc.). Having a mix like “the quiet one, the know-it-all, the comic, the cynic” helps provide contrast ([How to Create a Cast of Diverse Characters – Meg Dowell Writes](https://megdowell.com/2015/06/08/how-to-create-a-cast-of-diverse-characters/#:~:text=Choose%20personality%20types%20that%20compliment,one%20another)) and keeps interactions interesting.
- **Varied Skills and Strengths:** Each character brings something unique to the table. If they work as a team or interact closely, their abilities complement one another (for example, one’s street smarts balances another’s book smarts) ([How to Create a Cast of Diverse Characters – Meg Dowell Writes](https://megdowell.com/2015/06/08/how-to-create-a-cast-of-diverse-characters/#:~:text=anything%20exceptional%2C%20but%20they%20found,task%20and%20went%20after%20it%E2%80%94together)). Make sure one character isn’t redundant because another covers the exact same strengths.
- **Different Flaws & Weaknesses:** Similarly, each character has their own weaknesses. Their vulnerabilities should differ, or manifest in different ways, so that they each have distinct challenges. (This also opens opportunities for them to help each other.)
- **Range of Motivations:** Check that your characters aren’t all driven by the same motive. One might seek justice, another craves approval, another just wants to survive. This variety can create compelling conflicts and alliances.
- **Contrasting Backgrounds:** Wherever possible, introduce diversity in cultural background, upbringing, and perspective. Do they come from different social classes, ethnic backgrounds, or parts of the world? A cast with a mix of backgrounds can offer rich interactions and avoid a homogeneous feel. *(If your story has a fantastical setting, “background” could mean different fictional cultures, clans, planets, etc.)*
- **Balanced Emotional Tones:** Each character brings a different emotional tone or energy. For example, do you have a comedic character to lighten tense moments? A serious, grounded character to anchor drama? A romantic or optimistic soul to offer hope, and perhaps a pessimistic realist to question it? Ensure a good mix so that the overall mood isn’t one-note. *(This doesn’t mean you need one of each “type,” but be mindful of not having all characters share the same outlook.)*
- **Purpose in Story:** Every character (especially supporting ones) has a clear purpose in the narrative. You should be able to answer *why* each is in the story. (If two characters serve a similar purpose, consider combining them.) Ideally, each fulfills a different role: one might be the mentor figure, another the comic relief, another a foil to the hero, etc.
- **Relationships Make a Web:** Look at the network of relationships. Do you have a variety of connections (friendship, rivalry, family ties, mentorship, romance, etc.)? A balanced cast often features diverse relationship dynamics rather than all characters relating to one central character only.
- **Conflict and Chemistry:** Do different personalities spark interesting dynamics? Perhaps Character A and B constantly butt heads due to opposing traits, while C mediates. Ensure that there’s a mix of conflict and harmony – not everyone gets along perfectly (that would be boring!), but also not everyone is hostile.
- **Support & Challenge for Protagonist:** Each supporting character should either **support the protagonist’s journey or challenge them in a productive way** ([Balancing Out Your Cast of Characters ~ September C. Fawkes - Editor, Writer, Instructor](https://www.septembercfawkes.com/2022/06/balancing-out-your-cast-of-characters.html#:~:text=Consider%20what%20role%20the%20character,character%20who%20offers%20meaningful%20exchanges)). As a check, list how each secondary character influences your main character. If one doesn’t affect the protagonist (or plot) at all, they might need a stronger purpose or can be removed.
- **Diverse Voices:** If you were to write dialogue for each character, would it sound distinct? Consider speech patterns, slang or formal language, accents, catchphrases. A well-balanced cast has a range of voices (reflecting their background and personality).
- **Audience Appeal & Representation:** Finally, think about your audience and the real world. Does your cast offer someone for different readers to connect with? Are you avoiding stereotypes and tokenism in how you represent different groups? Every character, especially those representing real-world cultures or marginalized groups, should be three-dimensional and respectfully portrayed. Diversity is great, but it should be done thoughtfully ([Writing 'Diverse' Characters 2: Disability & Neurodiversity - Elise Carlson](https://elisecarlson.com/2024/02/07/writing-diverse-characters-part-2-big-dos/#:~:text=Even%20when%20simply%20putting%20marginalized,their%20own%20experiences%20and%20input)).

Go through these points and make notes or adjustments to your character profiles as needed. A diverse, balanced cast will not only make your story world feel richer but also help prevent characters from overlapping or competing for the same “space” in the story. Each should shine in their own way.

## **Interactive Character Development Prompts (for ChatGPT)**

You can further expand and refine your characters by **collaborating with ChatGPT** or a similar AI. By providing some details from your profile and using targeted prompts, you can have the AI generate additional insights, backstory scenes, or even dialogue for your character ([Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT for Character Development: A Guide for Writers | by Anurag Kumar | Medium](https://anuragkmr.medium.com/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-for-character-development-a-guide-for-writers-fe3897804e30#:~:text=ChatGPT%20comes%20in)). This can be a great way to combat writer’s block and discover new facets of your character – think of it as brainstorming with a creative partner. **Note:** Always review and tweak AI-generated content to ensure it fits your vision; use it as inspiration, not a final product ([Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT for Character Development: A Guide for Writers | by Anurag Kumar | Medium](https://anuragkmr.medium.com/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-for-character-development-a-guide-for-writers-fe3897804e30#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20character,and%20writing%20these%20elements%20manually)).

Here are some **reusable, general-purpose prompts** you can use with ChatGPT. Replace `[Character Name]` and bracketed details with your character’s information, and feel free to modify the prompts to suit your needs. Each prompt is designed to deepen a specific aspect of the character:

- **Character Backstory Prompt:** *“Describe a significant childhood event that shaped **[Character Name]**’s life. Include details about what happened, how it made them feel at the time, and how it still influences their fears or motivations today.”*  
  *Use this to generate a vivid backstory scene or memory. It can reveal trauma, proud moments, or turning points that explain your character’s current behavior.*

- **Personality & Traits Prompt:** *“Give a detailed overview of **[Character Name]**’s personality. What are their best qualities and worst flaws? How do they typically behave under stress, and how do they interact with friends versus strangers?”*  
  *This can help summarize and even uncover traits. It might highlight new angles or contradictions in their personality that you hadn’t considered.*

- **Physical Description Prompt:** *“Provide a rich physical description of **[Character Name]**. Include appearance (face, body, clothing) and body language. Show how they move or gesture, and mention how their appearance reflects their personality or background.”*  
  *Great for generating descriptive text you might use in your story. It can tie physical details to personality (e.g., “her tailored suits and erect posture reflect her military upbringing”).*

- **Goals & Motivation Prompt:** *“Outline **[Character Name]**’s current goals and the deeper motivation behind them. What do they want in the short term and long term? Why do these goals matter so much to them? Describe any inner conflict or fear that might make achieving these goals challenging.”*  
  *This prompt can articulate the driving forces of your character. The answer might give you clear statements of motivation you can use to steer plot decisions, and even suggest internal conflicts to exploit in the story.*

- **Strengths & Flaws Prompt:** *“List **[Character Name]**’s greatest strengths and biggest weaknesses. For each, provide a brief example or situation illustrating how it has helped or hindered them in the past.”*  
  *This will produce concrete examples of their traits in action (e.g., “Her compassion is a strength – she once helped a stranger at great personal cost. However, her compassion can turn into a weakness when she forgives people who hurt her.”). These examples can spark plot ideas or character moments.*

- **Relationships Prompt:** *“Describe **[Character Name]**’s relationships with the key people in their life (family, friends, enemies). Pick two relationships – one positive, one negative – and illustrate how those people influence **[Character Name]**’s emotions and choices.”*  
  *Use this to delve into dynamics. The AI might reveal, for instance, how a best friend’s support gives your character courage, while a rival at work brings out their competitive side. Such insight can guide how you write scenes involving those relationships.*

- **Dialogue & Voice Prompt:** *“Imagine **[Character Name]** in a conversation with [another character/a stranger]. Write a sample dialogue that showcases **[Character Name]**’s speaking style, tone, and personality. Let their unique voice come through, whether it’s in witty banter, thoughtful pauses, or blunt statements.”*  
  *This helps nail down the character’s voice. You can specify the scenario (talking with their mother, confronting their enemy, etc.) to see how their tone shifts. The dialogue produced can reveal catchphrases or tendencies (like rambling when nervous, or using lots of slang) that you might incorporate.*

- **Internal Monologue Prompt:** *“Write a short inner monologue from **[Character Name]**’s perspective as they face a difficult decision. Show their thoughts, feelings, and the pros/cons they consider, revealing their deepest concerns and values.”*  
  *This will give you a peek into their mind and moral compass. It’s useful for understanding how they reason through problems and what internal voices might conflict (e.g., duty vs. desire).*

- **Character Arc Prompt:** *“Sketch out a possible character arc for **[Character Name]** over the course of a story. Where do they start emotionally/mentally, and how could events change them? Describe key moments that would challenge them and how they might grow or deteriorate by the end.”*  
  *If you’re unsure about the character’s trajectory, this prompt can propose one. Even without a plot, it can suggest a general path (e.g., “starts as naive and becomes wise after betrayal” or “learns to overcome his fear of failure”). You can then decide if that arc fits the story you want or adjust accordingly.*

Feel free to iterate on the responses. For example, you can take a ChatGPT-generated backstory and ask follow-up questions: *“How would that event from childhood affect her in a relationship today?”* or *“Can you give me another possible scenario for his greatest fear and how he developed it?”* The AI can provide multiple angles, and you can pick the one that resonates most.

Using ChatGPT in this way can significantly speed up the brainstorming process ([Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT for Character Development: A Guide for Writers | by Anurag Kumar | Medium](https://anuragkmr.medium.com/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-for-character-development-a-guide-for-writers-fe3897804e30#:~:text=By%20inputting%20information%20about%20characters,and%20events%20for%20their%20characters)). It’s like having an “idea generator” at your disposal – it might propose things you hadn’t thought of. Many writers use these tools to **fill in the blanks** and inspire creative decisions ([Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT for Character Development: A Guide for Writers | by Anurag Kumar | Medium](https://anuragkmr.medium.com/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-for-character-development-a-guide-for-writers-fe3897804e30#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20character,and%20writing%20these%20elements%20manually)). Just remember that **you** are the author: keep the ideas that fit, and discard or tweak those that don’t. The end result should be characters that excite you and feel authentic to your story.
