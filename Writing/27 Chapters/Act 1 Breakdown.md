**Example Input:**

Act 1: Setup – Rex Avamar, a spy with the ability to create clones, discovers his family has been taken by the space mafia. As he prepares a daring infiltration with his unruly clones, he learns a shocking truth: his family has willingly joined the mafia, now under the leadership of Dark Rex—the discarded dark side of his own personality. Torn between rescuing them and facing the side of himself he rejected, Rex reluctantly teams up with Nova "Noa" Sterling, a rogue tech genius with questionable loyalties.

**Example Output:**

Here’s an expanded breakdown of **Act 1: Setup** using Kat O'Keefe's 27 Chapter Plot Structure:

- **Introduction & Inciting Incident:** Rex Avamar, a highly skilled but indecisive spy with the ability to create clones, is pulled from an otherwise routine mission when he receives an urgent message—his family has been taken by the space mafia. Determined to rescue them, he begins strategizing an infiltration, but his reliance on clones quickly leads to comedic chaos as they bicker and botch the simplest tasks. The stakes escalate when Rex learns that his family hasn't been kidnapped—they've _voluntarily joined_ the mafia, taking on administrative roles within its bureaucratic empire.

- **Call to Action & Refusal:** Rex is blindsided by the revelation that the mafia is now led by Dark Rex, a clone of himself containing the negative traits he once cast aside. Dark Rex reaches out with an ominous offer—Rex can either accept that his family prefers their new life under the mafia or face the consequences of trying to interfere. Doubting his ability to take down an organization that seems to function _better_ under his dark side’s leadership, Rex hesitates. However, when he sees firsthand how deeply entrenched his family has become in the organization, he realizes he must act, even if it means facing the side of himself he fears.

- **First Major Setback & Decision to Act:** Rex enlists the help of Nova "Noa" Sterling, a brilliant yet morally ambiguous tech expert with insider mafia knowledge. She agrees to help—though her true motives remain unclear. With her assistance, Rex and his clones attempt a small-scale infiltration to assess the mafia’s inner workings. However, the mission turns into a slapstick disaster when the clones’ clashing personalities derail their cover. Dark Rex anticipates their arrival and effortlessly outmaneuvers them, sending a message that Rex is out of his depth. Humiliated but more determined than ever, Rex commits to infiltrating deeper into the mafia, realizing he must reclaim control over both his family _and_ the fractured parts of himself.

**Key Improvements and rationale:**

- **Precise Framing:** Starts by reinforcing the LLM's role as a storytelling expert in plot structure application.
- **Specific Instruction to Use Previous output:** Telling it to insert the previous result will help the model follow directions better. It is more explicit.
- **Clearer Phrasing:** Improved vocabulary and sentence structure create clearer instructions.
- **Focus on Scene-Building:** The prompt emphasizes the goal of creating bullet points that inspire detailed scene development.
- **Better Structure:** Clearer ordering of instructions makes it easy for the LM to understand the output. For example, 5 steps is easier to read and follow verse a clump of run on text.

This prompt is carefully designed to provide a clear, specific, and instruction-rich foundation for the LLM to generate the desired expanded outline of Act 1. The structure of the bullet points has also been improved so each has a distinct title.
