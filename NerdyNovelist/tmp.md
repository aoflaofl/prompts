I want to expand a logline for a noir space opera espionage story.

A logline should have these elements:

* The protagonist or main character
* The context or setup of the story
* What the main character wants or is trying to achieve
* The antagonist or main obstacle facing the protagonist
* The main conflict or problem that drives the story
* An ironic hook or twist that makes the concept intriguing

The logline I want to expand is below.  Give me 20 expansions of it using the above elements.

A double agent navigates a space mafia to save his captured family.




A burnt agent, framed for a crime he didn't commit, has to escape from a prison orbiting a black hole to rescue his wrongly accused wife. The price of the escape is a devilâ€™s bargain with the Syndicate.
