## Definition of a Logline

A **logline** is a concise, one- or two-sentence summary of a story, designed to hook the audience and convey the central conflict, protagonist, and stakes. It serves as the "elevator pitch" for a film or TV series, capturing its essence in a compelling and memorable way.

## What Makes an Excellent Logline?

1. **Clarity**: It is easy to understand and free of jargon.
2. **Conflict**: Highlights the central challenge or obstacle.
3. **Character**: Introduces the protagonist in a way that reveals their goals and stakes.
4. **Specificity**: Avoids generic language by focusing on what makes the story unique.
5. **Brevity**: Typically 25â€“50 words, balancing detail with simplicity.
6. **Hook**: Contains an intriguing or emotional element that piques curiosity.
